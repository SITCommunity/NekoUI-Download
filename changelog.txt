CHANGELOG - NEKOUI 1.0-RELEASE+MC1.21.1
[ UI ]
- Widgets (including image buttons and text buttons) now animate out with a directional slide + fade-out effect when Clean Mode is enabled, and fade back in when toggled off.
- Added a new button in the title screen that toggles Clean Mode, a minimal UI state that hides all main buttons and shows only the animated background.
- Fixed an issue where widgets would reappear when resizing or toggling fullscreen, even while in Clean Mode.

[ RPC ]
- The presence now dynamically reflects the player’s game state — including transitioning between menus, singleplayer worlds, and multiplayer servers — in real-time.
- The Discord small image key now correctly updates based on the current dimension
- Redundant or excessive presence updates were eliminated via an internal cooldown and intelligent state comparison.
- The presence start timestamp now remains consistent during a game session, only resetting on major context changes (e.g. entering a new world or server).
  This prevents Discord from showing the activity as "just started" every few seconds.

[ BACKGROUND ]
- Added support for converting standard images into an in-game compatible format.
- Resolved an issue where colors in converted images appeared distorted or overly red.
- Transparency (alpha) is now preserved correctly during image processing.
- Improved color handling and consistency in image previews and rendering.
- Minor refinements to internal logging for better debugging support.
- Fallback system for invalid or missing background names. Now gracefully falls back to:
    - the built-in `default` background.
- Frame sorting now uses **numerical index parsing** rather than relying on strict file naming like `frame1.png`.
- Backgrounds with filenames containing numeric values (e.g., `bg_1.png`, `frame-1.jpg`, `1.jpeg`) are now supported.
- Files without any number in the name (e.g., `frame.png`, `frame.jpg`, `frame.jpeg`) are **ignored** and no longer interfere with animation order.
- Prevented loading animation backgrounds that only contain non-frame images.
- Improved detection reliability and fallback behavior when no valid frames exist.

[ IMPLEMENTATION ]
- Implement mod menu into fabric and quilt loaders

[ DEPRECATED ]
- Fix deprecated code on forge
- Fix url utility using deprecated API

[ CONFIG ]
- Optimized background selection screen performance for low-end devices.
- Only the selected background is animated during preview.
- Non-selected backgrounds now use static preview frames to reduce GPU/CPU load.
- Greatly reduces lag/freeze when opening the background config with many animated entries.
- Cleaned up visual focus by highlighting only the active selection with animation and border color.

[ UPDATE ]
- Fixed issue where `Show Details` button caused UI to overflow beyond window boundaries.
- Fixed `pack()` causing the window to lose its rounded corners and center alignment.
- Fixed frame not resizing properly when toggling the log area visibility.
- Fixed components misaligning when log area was shown.
- Replaced `setSize()` with `pack()` to dynamically adapt window size to content.
- Frame shape (rounded rectangle) is now reapplied after `pack()` to preserve custom window design.
- Toggling the details panel now updates both layout and shape to match the expanded height.
- "Enable Auto-Update" and "Show Details" are now placed side by side in a horizontal layout.
- Added minimum window size to prevent unexpected shrinking when log is hidden.

[ OTHER ]
- The native window title (top bar and taskbar) now displays `NekoUI [Minecraft Version]`
