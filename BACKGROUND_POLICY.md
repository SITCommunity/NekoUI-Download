# NekoUI Background Asset Policy
This document outlines the usage policy regarding background assets in the NekoUI project.

## Overview
NekoUI supports external **custom backgrounds** (static or animated) through a flexible resource pack system.  
These backgrounds are **not part of the core mod**, and may be modified, replaced, or redistributed independently.

## 1. Default Background
- The mod **only includes** a basic static background (solid black) by default.
- No copyrighted, third-party, or franchise-related backgrounds are bundled.

## 2. External Background Support
- Custom backgrounds must be placed in the following path:
- Animated backgrounds should include frame images with sequential names (e.g., `frame0.png`, `frame1.png`, ...).
- There is no hard limit on frame count.

## 3. Permissions
You are **allowed to**:
- Create and distribute your own background packs.
- Modify or remix background packs (if they are not part of the original mod).
- Share your packs publicly (e.g., on GitHub, Modrinth, CurseForge).

You are **not allowed to**:
- Redistribute NekoUI mod code or binaries together with your background packs.
- Misrepresent your background as "official" or endorsed by the Author.
- Include commercial or monetized backgrounds unless you fully own or have license to all assets included.

## 4. Disclaimer
- The Author (`nokarin`) is **not responsible** for any third-party backgrounds, user submissions, or potential IP infringement.
- You are fully responsible for ensuring that your background packs comply with any applicable copyright laws.

By using or distributing background assets through this system, you agree to abide by this policy.
