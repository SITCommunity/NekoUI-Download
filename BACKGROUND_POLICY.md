## Summary

- NekoUI supports external **custom backgrounds** (static or animated) through a flexible resource pack system.

   - No copyrighted third-party backgrounds are included.

2. **External Background Support**

     `assets/nekoui/background/<name>/`
   - You can include as many frames as needed for animation.

3. **Permissions**
   - You may:
     - Create your own background packs.
     - Modify or remix existing backgrounds (as long as theyâ€™re not part of the mod).
     - Share your backgrounds publicly (e.g. Modrinth, GitHub).
   - You may NOT:
     - Redistribute NekoUI mod code or binaries with your backgrounds.
     - Claim official association with the NekoUI project.
     - Include commercial/monetized backgrounds unless you own full rights.
